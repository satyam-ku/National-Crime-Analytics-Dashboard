# National Crime Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a **National Crime Analytics Dashboard** built using **Power BI**, aimed at analyzing crime data across multiple years and dimensions. The dashboard is designed to help users explore crime patterns, identify trends, and support data-driven decision-making through interactive and professional visualizations.

The project focuses on transforming raw crime datasets into **actionable insights** using effective data modeling, DAX calculations, and intuitive dashboard design.
